# Redux thunks
[Blog post explaining Redux thunks in Finnish](https://anttituomola.fi/redux-ja-thunk-middleware/)

# Recourses and links
These links help me understand the concept of thunks:
- [Official docs](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)
- [Official docs, part 2](https://redux.js.org/usage/writing-logic-thunks)
- [This old but really simple and still relevant video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QI-UE3-0PU)

# Issues?
If you get an error: "Plugin "react" was conflicted between "package.json Â» eslint-config-react-app" just open the package.json and re-save it. That should solve the issue.

In case you have to repeat this every time the site rerenders, do this instead: In your terminal cd (means go) yourself to the folder where the project is and re-run npm start. Use the correct casing, so be sure to write Desktop insted of desktop, if that is the correct version of the folder.

This problem is Windows-specific.
